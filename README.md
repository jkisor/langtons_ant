“Langton’s Ant is 4-state two-dimensional Turing machine invented in the 1980s. The ant starts out on a grid containing black and white cells, and then follows the following set of rules.
1. If the ant is on a black square, it turns right 90 degrees and moves forward one unit.

2. If the ant is on a white square, it turns left 90 degrees and moves forward one unit.

3. When the ant leaves a square, it inverts the color.”
